// create a variable called speedLimit and another called mySpeed
// set their values to numbers between 1 and 100


// using a conditional, determine if mySpeed is greater than the speedLimit
// if true, print "Slow Down! Mom is mad!" to the console
// if mySpeed is equal to the speedLimit, print "Everyone is happy!" to the console
// if mySpeed is less than the speedLimit, print "Speed up! Dad is mad!"


// create two variables, one named alarmSet, the other openDoor
// set them to a boolean value


// using a conditional, determine if alarm is set. 
// if alarm is set and door is set to open, print "Sound Alarm!" to the console
// otherwise, print "Everything is fine." to the console.




// create two variables, username and password
// create a conditional, if the username is "Tommy123" and the password is "12345"
// or the username is "Timmy456" and the password is "6789", print "Admin Login Successful" to the console
// otherwise, print "Admin Access Denied"




// write code that will set the value of studentClass based on studentGrade
// studentGrade will be K-12
// K-6 will be Elementary
// 7-8 will be Middle
// 9 will be Freshman, 10 Sophomore, 11 Junior, 12 Senior
// Anything other than these values will return "Error" to the console





// write a for loop that will iterate backwards from 10 to -10



// write a do/while loop that prints 1 through 50


// edit the previous do/while loop so that it prints the remainder when the loop number is divided by 4


// Someone messed up the following for loop
// fix the following infinite loop, uncomment to test
/* 
    for(let i = 11; i > 10; i++){
        console.log(i);
    }
