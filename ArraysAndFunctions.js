// create a variable called myTodoList that holds an empty array

// add three todo items to the array using a built-in array method

// remove the second item in the array

// create another array, yourTodoList, and add two todo items

// create another array, ourTodoList
// combine myTodoList and yourTodoList into ourTodoList


// sort the following array from Z-A

// create a function called reverse that takes in parameter

// if its a boolean, return the opposite
// if its a number, or a string, return the reverse (i.e. 1234 becomes 4321, Name becomes emaN)
// if its an array, return the reversed array with each element reversed


// create a function called addingMachine that will add all passed numbers and return the total

// You just signed a contract as an estimator for a restoration company. 
// Your contract states that you take home 10% of the profits on the first $100,000
// 20% on the next $400,000

// 40% on all profits above $1,000,000
// create a function that will allow you to check how much of a bonus you make
// the function should take in two variables as arguments, grossInvoiced and profitMargin
